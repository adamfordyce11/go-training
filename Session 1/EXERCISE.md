# Exercise: Hello, World! in Go

In this exercise, you will create and run a simple "Hello, World!" program in Go.

## Instructions

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

3. Save the file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

5. Run the program using the go run command followed by the file name (e.g., go run hello_world.go).

6. Verify that the output "Hello, World!" is printed to the console.

7. Take a screenshot of the program running and share it with the instructor or the class.
